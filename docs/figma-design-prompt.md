# Heat Loss Calculator App - Figma Design Brief

## Project Overview
Design a web application that allows users to upload room images, which are analyzed by AI to calculate heat loss and provide energy efficiency recommendations.

## Key User Flows
1. **Image Upload & Processing**
   - Drag-drop upload area
   - Multi-image selection
   - Mobile camera integration
   - Progressive upload with visual feedback
   - Image preview/management

2. **Analysis & Results**
   - Processing status indicators
   - Interactive 3D room model
   - Heat map visualization
   - Drill-down details on specific areas
   - Recommendation cards with before/after comparisons

3. **Navigation & Form Interactions**
   - Step indicator showing progress
   - Smart defaults with inline validation
   - Contextual help elements
   - Save/resume functionality

## Core UI Components
- **Dashboard Layout**: Panels for upload, results, 3D view, and recommendations
- **Upload Zone**: Visual cues for drag-drop and file selection
- **3D Visualization**: Interactive room model with heat map toggle
- **Recommendation Cards**: Swipeable/scrollable improvement suggestions
- **Form Elements**: Unit toggles, validation, tooltips
- **Navigation**: Breadcrumb-style progress indicator

## Visual Styling
- **Color Palette**: 
  - High-contrast scheme
  - Intuitive heat gradients (blue→red)
  - Dark mode support
  - WCAG AA compliant (minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio)

- **Typography**:
  - Clean, legible sans-serif for UI elements
  - Clear hierarchy with distinct headings
  - Minimum 16px body text

- **Visual Elements**:
  - Subtle glassmorphism for card components
  - Micro-interactions (hover effects, progress indicators)
  - Illustrative icons for recommendations
  - Minimalist dashboard layout

## Accessibility Requirements
- Large touch targets (min 44×44px)
- Keyboard navigable interface
- Screen reader compatible components
- Color-independent information (patterns + colors)
- Resizable text support

## Responsive Breakpoints
- Mobile: 320-480px (stacked layout, simplified visualizations)
- Tablet: 481-768px (hybrid layout, touch-optimized)
- Desktop: 769px+ (dashboard layout, detailed visualizations)

## Priority Screens to Design
1. Homepage/Upload screen
2. Processing/Analysis view
3. Results dashboard with 3D visualization
4. Detailed recommendation view
5. Mobile adaptations of key screens

## Brand Identity
- Professional but approachable
- Focus on clarity and data visualization
- Convey technical expertise with accessible presentation
