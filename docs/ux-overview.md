# UX Overview for Heat Loss Calculation Web App

This document outlines the user experience (UX) strategy and modern UI/UX styling practices for the heat loss calculation web application.

## Modern UI/UX Styling Recommendations

### Color Schemes
- Use high-contrast palettes for readability and accessibility. Heatmaps should use intuitive gradients (e.g., blue for cool, red for hot) with sufficient contrast for color vision deficiencies.
- Support dark mode for reduced eye strain and battery savings.
- Apply glassmorphism (subtle frosted blurs) only where text remains readable.

### Layout
- Prioritize clarity and simplicity; group related controls and data logically.
- Use dashboard layouts with panels for image upload, AI results, 3D/heatmap view, and summary controls.
- Employ visual hierarchy: make primary actions (e.g., "Upload Image", "Run Analysis") prominent.
- Responsive grids for desktop; stacked/tabbed layouts for mobile/tablet.

### Accessibility
- Ensure keyboard navigation and ARIA labeling for assistive tech compatibility.
- Use WCAG-compliant color contrasts; check overlays and labels with tools like WebAIM.
- Enable text resizing and adaptive UI for low vision/motor impairments.
- Provide textual/tabular alternatives and descriptive tooltips for visualizations.
- Avoid relying solely on colorâ€”use patterns, icons, or numeric values for clarity.

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach: large touch targets, swipe/zoom controls for 3D views.
- Optimize performance for quick loading and graceful degradation on low-end devices.
- Use modals for details, collapsible menus, and adaptive dashboards (side-drawer/overlay navigation for mobile).

### Modern Enhancements
- Integrate micro-interactions (hover effects, progress spinners, subtle animations).
- Provide guided onboarding or interactive tooltips for 3D/heatmap controls.
- Transparently communicate AI-driven personalization.

#### Summary Table: Core Styling Recommendations

| Area         | Practice                                                     |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Color        | High-contrast, intuitive heatmap gradients, dark mode       |
| Layout       | Clean dashboard, clear grouping, visual hierarchy           |
| Accessibility| WCAG contrast, keyboard nav, screen-reader compatible       |
| Responsive   | Mobile-first, fast load, adaptive layouts                   |
| Visual Trends| Selective glassmorphism, micro-animations, custom 3D/illustration |

Staying at the intersection of clarity, inclusivity, and immersive data visualization is key to a modern, user-friendly heat loss calculation app.

## User Experience (UX)

### Interaction Patterns

#### Image Upload Interactions
- **Drag-and-drop Zone**: Users can drag images directly into a highlighted area
- **Multi-image Selection**: Users can select multiple images at once from their device
- **Camera Integration**: Mobile users can take photos directly within the app
- **Progressive Upload**: Images begin uploading immediately upon selection rather than waiting for a submit button
- **Upload Feedback**: Visual progress indicator shows upload status for each image
- **Image Preview**: Thumbnails appear with options to rotate, zoom, or remove before processing
- **Image Requirements**: Clear guidance on minimum resolution and lighting recommendations
- **Batch Management**: Users can add or remove images from the processing queue

#### Analysis & Processing Interactions
- **Auto-proceed**: After successful upload, processing begins automatically
- **Processing Status**: Animated progress indicator with estimated completion time
- **Cancelable Process**: Users can cancel analysis during processing if needed
- **Error Recovery**: If image analysis fails, specific suggestions for better photos are provided
- **Image Analysis Details**: Users can see which specific features were detected in each image

#### Form & Data Input Patterns
- **Smart Defaults**: Fields pre-populated based on AI analysis
- **Inline Validation**: Immediate feedback on input errors
- **Contextual Help**: Information tooltips next to technical fields
- **Unit Toggles**: Easy switching between metric and imperial measurements
- **Guided Correction**: If users need to correct AI-detected values, clear visual cues show acceptable ranges
- **Save Progress**: Automatic saving of partial data entry with restore capability

#### Results & Visualization Interactions
- **Interactive 3D Model**: Users can rotate and explore a simplified 3D model of their room
- **Heat Map Overlay**: Toggle between normal view and heat loss visualization
- **Drill-down Details**: Click on any room element (wall, window, floor) to see detailed heat loss analysis
- **Comparative Sliders**: Interactive before/after sliders when viewing improvement recommendations
- **Recommendation Cards**: Swipeable cards with improvement suggestions
- **Expandable Sections**: Technical details hidden by default but expandable for interested users
- **Share & Export**: One-click options to generate PDF reports or shareable links

#### Navigation Patterns
- **Step Indicator**: Clear visual indicator of progress through the assessment workflow
- **Conditional Steps**: Some steps appear only if relevant (e.g., additional details for complex rooms)
